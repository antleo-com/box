## Koine Resources

Here are some helpful resources if you're on the road to learning Koine greek: 

### Books

* Basics of Biblical Greek by William D Mounce: Highly recommended as it makes what is quite tough, somewhat easy
* Basics of Biblical Greek: If you are self-learning, this is an essential companion to the text book, without which it will be difficult to practice and retain the learnings
* A Manual greek lexicon of the New Testament by G. Abbott-Smith: Though there are many online lexicons as listed below, if you prefer a physical lexicon, this is a good one
* Greek Verbs in the New Testament and Their Principal Parts by Laurence Vance: Once I was done going through the basics, I found principle parts of the verbs to be quite complex. This helpful book lists them all. I haven't bought this one yet but its on my wish list
* Greek grammar beyond the basics by Daniel B Wallace: Once done with Mounce, this is the next recommended step into intermediate greek, as recommended by Mounce himself

### Online Greek Bibles and Lexicons

* [Simple, online greek new testament reader](https://gntreader.com/){:target="_blank"} : A simple easy-to-use online reader version of the greek new testament. It is also keyed to the Abbott Smith Lexicon for quick reference.
* [LaParola Lexicons](https://www.laparola.net/greco/index.php){:target="_blank"} : If you scroll down a bit on this page and click on "Search by Louw-Nida category or English gloss" you can find the relevant entries in various Lexicons all on one page; Strong's, Thayer's, and Luow Nida
* [Greekdoc Parsings](https://greekdoc.github.io/){:target="_blank"} : This is one of the best sites I've found for finding out all the principle parts for verb parsings. Select a NT and then click on any verb, it gives you loads of useful information on the related nouns, adjectives, and verbals forms. And invaluable resource.
* [Customizable online Reader](https://biblewebapp.com/reader/){:target="_blank"} : This site enables you to create a customized greek NT reader version. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an option to print out what you have created.
* [Perseus's Morpheus (Greek Word Study Tool)](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?lang=greek){:target="_blank"}: Type in a greek word using an english keyboard and get its parsings, forms, lexicon entries etc. Very useful.

### Online Support

* [http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/](http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/forum/){:target="_blank"} : This is a fantastic community of beginner and extremely experienced koine greek scholars who are helpful and willing to provide support and encouragement and doubts resolution for beginners

### Printables

* [A PDF version of The Greek New Testament
  For Beginning Readers](https://byzantinetext.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RP2016-Readers-Edition.pdf){:target="_blank"} : This has been especially useful in speeding up the process of biblical texts. It has definitions and parsings of less common words on each page, as well as a quick reference lexicon of all verb parsings at the end of the book. I've printed out the lexicon as a seperate spiral bound book, and often carry printouts of the smaller epistles with me as I travel for a quick translation exercise.
* [Dr. William Mounce's teaching Overeads](http://ntgreek.org/swc/GreekCO411/mounce.pdf){:target="_blank"} : These are a concise summary of all the important rules and paradigms. I've printed these out and bound them into a spiral book so I can easily reference instead of always having to search through the grammar book.
* [Prinicipal parts of verbs ending in labials](https://www.promotelatin.org/images/stories/pdf/Greek/GREEKCoreverbs-stemlabial.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Helpful for studying the prinicipal parts of verbs; many other similar pdfs on other greek grammar aspects are available [here](https://www.promotelatin.org/images/stories/pdf/Greek/){:target="_blank"}
* [Koine Greek Paradigms](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpY2hlZ3JlZWt8Z3g6NTNkYmE4MjYxMzFiZjA0ZQ){:target="_blank"} : Nicely arranged printable for easy reference
* [A different look at prepositions](https://www.wikichristian.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Koine_Greek:_Prepositions&oldid=669404){:target="_blank"} : From wikichristian
* [Irregular verbs](http://pietrociavarella.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/irregularverbsgnt.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Handy guide
* [Another one on prinicple parts](https://wermuthsgreekbook.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/principal-parts-of-greek-verbs-chart.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Wermuth's greek book
* [Berean Bibles](https://berean.bible/downloads.htm){:target="_blank"} : Free PDF and Word versions of the Berean Greek NT and the Berean Interlinear Bible are available here.
* [Scripture4all Interlinears](https://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/Greek_Index.htm){:target="_blank"} : These interlinears are available as chapter wise downloads and have the parsings included. I frequently print out a few chapters and carry them with me along with a print out of the same chapter in a reader's version above. A great resource, but the only thing is it uses all caps for the greek. I wish it used lower case instead.
* [Nifty greek handouts](https://classics.uchicago.edu/people/helma-dik/nifty-greek-handouts){:target="_blank"} : Some of these are useful to print out and study the various forms
* [A Intermediate Guide to Greek Diagramming](http://ericsowell.com/things-i-make/koineworks-diagramming){:target="_blank"} : A useful guide to diagramming

### Memorization and Learning Aids

* [Ankidroid app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/){:target="_blank"} : This very helpful app can be used to memorize koine vocabulary. It has a very good learning environment that lets you review words based on their difficulty and your progress. The apps are opensource and available for most operating systems and mobiles. [Ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/about){:target="_blank"} , which is the companion website, has a readymade set of flashcards based on Dr. Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek text book. All you need to do is create a free account, log in and search for Mounce and you should be able to find it.
* [Mastergreek parsing practice tool](https://www.mastergreek.com/){:target="_blank"}: It's free and very useful for practicing and retaining all those forms and paradigms in memory, but has ads.
* [Ancient greek tutorials](http://atticgreek.org/){:target="_blank"}: Free and helpful drills for all kinds of vocab exercises. You can also download and use the older version of these drills on your computer without internet acces with these files [here](https://ucbclassics.dreamhosters.com/ancgreek/AGTdownload.zip){:target="_blank"}

### Software

* [Bible Strong App](){:target="_blank"} : For Android tablets, I find the free Bible Strong app to be an excellent tool to read and reference the Koine. It is not too heavy on features and has a very usable interface to read the greek directly or with the help of an interlinear. Side Note: I use a Boox tablet with an e-ink screen which is very good for the eyes. These are available from [the Boox website](https://www.boox.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [Step Bible](https://www.stepbible.org/downloads.jsp){:target="_blank"} : This is a good, free bible app with ancient languages included that is available online and for desktop, mobile. It has many, many versions and languages of the Bible with helpful tools and aids for original language studies. I use this on my desktop.
* [Bible-Discovery](http://www.bible-discovery.com/bible-download.php){:target="_blank"} : Another free bible study software with original languages. I haven't used this one much but will do so and update here. However, I see that many of the useful features are available free only for a 10-day trial period

### Even More Online Greek Bibles

* [Abarim Interlinear](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Interlinear-New-Testament/index.html){:target="_blank"} : Some of their concordance entries are quite detailed and helpful
